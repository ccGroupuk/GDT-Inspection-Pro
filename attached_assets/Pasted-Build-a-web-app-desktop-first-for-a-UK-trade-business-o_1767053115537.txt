Build a web app (desktop-first) for a UK trade business owner that combines Work/Life Balance + Business Day Planner + Quoting/Invoices with a Supplier Product Finder.
The user journey must start with a “Daily Start” flow on login.

1) Login → “Daily Start” Flow (must appear first)

Step A: Life Balance Dashboard (2–3 minutes)

Display: time, today’s date, weather optional

Quick check buttons:

“Drank water in last hour?” (Yes/No)

“Breakfast eaten?” (Yes/No)

“Medication taken?” (Yes/No)

“Stretch / 2 min walk?” (Start timer)

Personal reminders feed:

Cindy (admin role) can add: dentist, kids play dates, family tasks, time cut-offs for work

Auto reminders:

Water: every 60 minutes during working hours

Break: every 2.5–3 hours

“Stop work” cut-off time (editable)

Output of Step A is a “Ready Score” (simple progress bar), then button: “Start Business Day”

Step B: Business Day Planner Overview (single clean screen)

At-a-glance cards:

Today’s schedule (installs, quotes, meetings)

Priority 3 tasks (must-do)

Admin tasks (calls, emails, invoices)

Team activity (what Cindy/team are doing)

“Where I’m meant to be now” indicator:

Uses current time + today schedule to show:

“You should be: Installing / Quoting / Admin / Travel / Break”

Quick action buttons:

“Create Quote”

“Create Invoice”

“Add Task”

“Log Tool/Van Fault”

“Message Cindy”

End of overview: button “Open Work Mode” (goes to main app navigation)

2) Quoting + Invoicing System (core)

Core features

Clients: store client details, address, property notes

Jobs: create job with status pipeline (Enquiry → Estimate → Quote Sent → Accepted → Scheduled → In Progress → Sign-off → Review Request)

Quotes:

Line items: product/material, labour, delivery, margin

Save templates for common jobs

Export PDF

Invoices:

Convert from accepted quote

Deposit and staged payments

Payment status tracking

3) Product Catalog + Supplier Product Finder (the key feature)

Goal: When creating quote/invoice line items, user can add products even if not already stored in the app.

Flow in quote line items

Search bar: “Search my catalog”

If no match: show button “Search Supplier”

Supplier selector list (multi-store support):

B&Q, Howdens, Screwfix, Toolstation, Travis Perkins, Selco, Wickes (admin can add/remove suppliers)

Two modes (implement Mode 1 first, design app to upgrade to Mode 2 later):

Mode 1 (Option 2A): Supplier Link + Capture (MVP)

Open supplier site inside in-app browser (or new tab if easier)

User finds product page

Button: “Capture to Quote”

Capture fields (manual + auto where possible):

supplier_name

product_title

sku_or_product_code

price

unit (each/pack/m/m²)

product_url

image_url (optional)

captured_at timestamp

After capture:

Show confirmation modal:

Quantity input

Markup % (default from settings)

“Add to this quote only” OR “Save to catalog”

“Saved to catalog” creates a new internal product record with:

internal_product_id

supplier reference fields above

category tags (user selects)

Mode 2 (Option 2B): Supplier Aggregator (future upgrade)

Backend service called “Supplier Aggregator”

For supported suppliers, the backend can fetch product results by keyword and return:

title, sku, price, unit, availability (if available), url, image

The UI must allow choosing results from multiple suppliers and adding to quote

Must store “last verified price time”

If supplier fetch fails, fallback to Mode 1 capture

4) Settings + Admin Controls

Roles: Owner, Admin (Cindy), Staff, Trade Partner (optional future)

Supplier management:

Enable/disable suppliers

Add custom supplier (name + homepage URL)

Defaults:

Markup % per category

Labour rates

Reminder intervals + working hours + stop-work cut-off time

Data storage:

database tables for clients, jobs, quotes, invoices, products, captured_products, reminders, tasks, users

5) UX Rules (important)

Must be fast and minimal (trade-owner friendly)

The Day Overview must be “one screen, no clutter”

Every key action should be max 2 clicks away:

Quote, Invoice, Add Product, Add Task

Supplier product capture must feel instant and not “techy”

6) Deliverables

Provide working screens:

Daily Start (Life Balance → Business Overview)

Quotes list + quote builder

Product picker with Supplier Search + Capture

Basic settings page with supplier list

Use clean modern UI with large buttons and clear sections.
