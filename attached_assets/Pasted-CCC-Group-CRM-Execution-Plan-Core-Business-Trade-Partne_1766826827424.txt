CCC Group CRM – Execution Plan

(Core Business + Trade Partner Jobs)

⸻

1️⃣ Core CRM Philosophy (Important)

One CRM. One pipeline. Multiple delivery paths.

Every enquiry comes into CCC first.
Then it is either:
	•	✅ Delivered in-house, or
	•	🤝 Assigned to a trade partner

The client always feels like they’re dealing with Cardiff & Caerphilly Carpentry.

2️⃣ High-Level CRM Structure (for App Designer)

Core Objects / Tables

Your CRM should be built around these core objects:
